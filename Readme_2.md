So far we have reviewed the project selection process and the various organization structures that projects can operate in.Once an organization selects their portfolio of projects, they must initiate the projects.
Now we will explore how to initiate a project in detail. The first phase in the project lifecycle is initiation. 
In this phase, the project manager learns the objectives of the project, 
the business reasons for which it was selected, information about project deliverables, timeline, and budget, 
and gains approval to proceed with the project. We will also explore a key initiation deliverable called the Project Charter. 
The initiation phase is an important phase to the project because it lays the foundation for the reasons the project is undertaken
and the primary business benefits and goals the project is expected to achieve. 
The initiation phase solidifies these elements and ensures all stakeholders are in agreement about the reasons and 
objectives for the project. It also serves as an acknowledgement by management of the resources required to deliver the project, 
including the budget, the schedule, and the scope.
